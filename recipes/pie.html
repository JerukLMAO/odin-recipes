    <h2>Strawberrry Pie by OKBEE</h2>

    <p>This strawberry pie is my favorite pie, and it's very easy to make. I got the recipe many years ago in North Jersey from the Sussex County Strawberry Farm.</p>    

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 quart fresh strawberries, hulled</li>
        <li>1 (9 inch) pie crust, baked</li>
        <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons cornstarch</li>
        <li>¾ cup water</li>
        <li>½ cup heavy whipping cream</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Arrange 1/2 of strawberries in baked pastry shell. Place remaining strawberries in a medium saucepan.</li>
        <li>Add sugar to the strawberries in the saucepan; place over medium heat and bring to a boil, stirring frequently.</li>
        <li>Whisk cornstarch and water together in a small bowl. Gradually stir cornstarch mixture into boiling strawberry mixture. Reduce heat and simmer mixture until thickened, about 10 minutes, stirring constantly.</li>
        <li>Pour cooked strawberry mixture over berries in pastry shell. Refrigerate until chilled and set, at least 3 hours.</li>
        <li>Before serving, whip cream in a medium bowl until soft peaks form. Serve each slice of pie with a dollop of whipped cream.</li>
    </ol>
